## About / Synopsis

When creating an open source project, a detailed README file makes all the difference in a developers repository. The README file will offer other developers all of the information and tools they need to install and run the application and give descriptive guidelines for addressing issues and making contributions.
  
  README Generator offers a template md file for developers to fill out from the command line, allowing them to spend more time developing and less time thinking about formatting their README file.

  ### Supported Commands
  
  This is a command line app. The user will be able to input their responses in a single line format when prompted and use the return key to submit.
  
  For checkbox prompts, the user will be able to navigate the options using the arrow keys, select using the space bar and submit using the return key.

  ### Syntax Highlighting
  
  User can use back-ticks **without using the return key** to enable code blocks

  ### Returns
  
  User can also format text with returns by typing designated command in-line

## Test Instructions

As of now, README Generator is a simple prototype for what could become a more robust command line application. There are no immediate concerns regarding bugs but I encourage all users to test as they desire.
